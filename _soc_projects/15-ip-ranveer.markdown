Ability to crop all the images in a folder, for (a simple) example. What would you do? A programmer would probably write a huge python script. A non-programmer would do it one by one. This will do the following (for example)  `im-toolkit -do crop 12 12 23 23 *jpg` Cool, right? And cropping is just one thing, we can make it open source and make it modular enough to add more functions.
