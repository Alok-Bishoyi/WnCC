Scilab Textbook Companion (TBC) is one of the flagship activities undertaken by FOSSEE. It is a collection of code for each solved example of a standard textbook. We have active Scilab and Python TBCs. Students and faculty of colleges have created more than 500 Scilab TBC and a similar number of Python TBC. As there are about 50,000 scripts in 500 TBCs, it becomes a valuable resource for documentation, function usage search and also as a subject learning material.
