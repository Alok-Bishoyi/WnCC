There are a couple of open source projects at Mozilla you could work on. A UI revamp and few more features needed for <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/wptview">wptview</a>. Another project needing contributors is <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder">Perfherder</a>, which monitors performance tests on Firefox.
